About
=====
wolfbot-pl is an advanced Perl IRC implementation of the game of Werewolf (AKA
Mafia), using POE::Component::IRC. The bot supports:

* a variety of roles: next to the standard Villager, Wolves and Seer we have a
Village Idiot, Doppleganger, Angel and Finder.
* IRC administration, no need to reboot the bot for small configuration changes
* game themes
* anonymous mode!
* name completion when voting
* and much more... 

Installation
============
Wolfbot depends on POE::Component::IRC. You can easily install this by
using the CPAN tool that comes with your Perl installation.
Make sure to fill in the connection details at the start of the program.
